##Resources

- [Drawer Plugin](http://git.blivesta.com/drawer/)

This plugin gave my website an off screen navigation menu that is activated by a hamburger icon. Additionally, the functionality of this plugin, along with the FullPage plugin, allowed the menu item of the current page to become highlighted. This menu can be found on all pages of the site.

- [FullPage Plugin](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#firstPage)

This plugin made my website a single scroll site. All of the content for each page can be found on the screen (content on a certain page will not be found below the fold). 

Other than these plugins, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

##Comments

- Custom Javascript Code

This code can be found on the contact page of my site. This code makes each social media icon larger upon mouse over and normal size upon mouse out.

- Custom jQuery Code 

This code can be found on each of the menu pages. This code changes the background color of each menu item to either a dark or light orange (depending on the page background color) upon hover, then changes it back to the normal background color.

This was the most frustrating coding project I have ever worked on because of how limiting the FullPage plugin was. When I first discovered it, I thought it was so beautiful, however as I was coding my site, especially the mobile version, I found that the amount of content placed on each page was limited because nothing could be placed below the fold. Because of this, I was not able to incorporate my images into the mobile version, making it very copy heavy.

Although I wish I could've made a better site, it was beneficial, in a sense, learning how to work in VERY constricted dimensions. It's interesting to see how much we rely on the area below the fold to incorporate a normal amount of content. 

Either way, I would not have used that plugin if I did this project again and I will not be using it in the future (unless I need to display very little content).

Just a tip, whenever resizing, it is best to refresh the page so that the dimensions of the site don't become wonky.
